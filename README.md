Projects for the Coursera course: From Nand to Tetris Parts I &amp; II

[From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is one of the top-rated courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). This course is a project-based course on computer architecture and compilers. Along the course, students will build a computer, a machine language, an assembly language and its assembler, a high-level languange and its compiler, an OS, and a game which is written in the high-level language and running on the OS. In this course everything is built from scratch. The whole project is gradually built upon the single one chip that is given - the Nand gate.
